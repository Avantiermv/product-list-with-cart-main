## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript properties
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned: I improved my knowledge of some aspects of javascript, for example, the use of json files, functions, arrow functions and addEventListeners. BUT, I need to study a lot more. Analyzing other codes, I realized that my code has some problems to be solved. 

### Continued development

I need to study more about design patterns, functional programming, event delegation, web components and code organization.
